# Voronoi Playground
During my research of beautiful generative arts patterns was fascinated by these beautiful voronoi diagrams, that deliver a cell-like structure. Therefore I sketched a jiggling animation with it via P5 and a voronoi library. Feel free to check it out here: https://mekiii.github.io/Voronoi-P5/
 

*"In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells."*[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram)
